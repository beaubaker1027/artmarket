# ArtMarket

ArtMarket is a kind of social media art store.

This project is a WIP and will likely change as time goes on.  ArtMarket is a project I started to test my comprehension of the MEAN stack.  I had a few set goals in mind and a few things I was trying to continue learning.

## Goals

My goals of this project:
-Authentication/Authorization
 -password encryption
 -authorization guards
 -storing/retrieving user data
-Angular
 -expand on/learn more about making a modular application
 -work more with typescript/angular
 -learn more about how single page applications and DOM manipulation work
-Mongo
 -work with mLab
 -file encoding/decoding
  ->I now plan to build another application to handle file storage.  I think a seperate file storage system will work better than storing encoded images in mongo.

## Current Tasks

-complete styling
 ->I changed some of the styling recently and I like that better.
-fix settings routing
-work on improving angular modularity
-design file storage application
